Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, 
gradually improving its accuracy. Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. 
Through the use of statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions, uncovering key insights within data mining projects. 
These insights subsequently drive decision making within applications and businesses, ideally impacting key growth metrics. As big data continues to expand and grow, 
the market demand for data scientists will increase, requiring them to assist in the identification of the most relevant business questions and subsequently the data 
to answer them. In this session we will learn how to use Automated Machine Learning to create and apply a binary prediction model in Power BI using Python, 
Anaconda and Pycaret to quickly classify data.
